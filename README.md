Hi, I’m Tiago. I'm some guy based in the Bay Area.
I’m not interested in WebDev but can spin up a website.
I am interested in systems programming and microcontrollers but know relatively little about it.
I am very interested in ML and know a little bit about it.

How to reach me: email tiagoflora@uni.minerva.edu
