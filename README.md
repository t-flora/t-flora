- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiago. I'm a builder based in the Bay Area
- 👀 I’m interested in WebDev, systems programming, ML, microcontrollers, automation in general, and economics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Rust, and Arduino. React for fun, Rust out of deep interest, and Arduino for silly ideas
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects or anything to do with systems programming
