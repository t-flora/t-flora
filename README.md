Hi, I’m Tiago. I'm a Financial Mathematics MS student at the University of Chicago, concentrating in high-performance computing and ML/AI.
I once built a simple von Neumann machine emulator and realized I really enjoyed building it.
Deeply interested in AI and its consequences. Up-to-date on its capabilities.
